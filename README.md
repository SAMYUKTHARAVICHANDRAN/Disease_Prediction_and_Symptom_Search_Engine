#Disease Prediction and Symptom Search Engine

A DSA-based Java project that predicts possible diseases from user-provided symptoms. It applies efficient data structures and algorithms to deliver real-time autocomplete, analyze disease connections, and rank predictions using a hybrid confidence model.

Key Features

1.Trie: Enables fast and accurate symptom autocomplete

2.Weighted Graph: Models disease interconnections through shared symptoms

3.PageRank Algorithm: Determines disease importance within the network

4.Hybrid Scoring System: Combines symptom score and PageRank score

5.TimSort: Efficiently ranks predictions by confidence
